<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
     made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. <br>
     A more traditional homemade 
     lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe 
     calls for a blend of small-curd cottage <br> cheese and Parmesan. 
     I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
