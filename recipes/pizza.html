<h2 class="title">Description</h2>
<p class="text">This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
     made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. <br>
     A more traditional homemade 
     lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe 
     calls for a blend of small-curd cottage <br> cheese and Parmesan. 
     I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
<br>
    <h2 class="title">Ingridients</h2>

    <ul class="text">
        <li>1 small onion, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
     <ol class="text">
        <li>Place onion in a food processor and finely chop. Transfer onion to a piece of cheesecloth and squeeze out the liquid. Place onion in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix lamb, beef, garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, and salt with the onion using your hands until well mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
